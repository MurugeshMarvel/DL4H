Deep learning for hackers: a hands-on approach to machine learning and deep learning.

Currently only covers "from logistic regression to adding hidden layers".

***The only requirement is to fully code something from python/numpy before allowing it to be done in Theano / using other's CUDA kernels***

TODO:
  - more machine learning principles (e.g. cross-validation)
  - convolutions in numpy
  - RNNs
